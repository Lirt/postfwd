1.03
====
- feature: request attributes can now be compared (e.g. to compare client_name and helo_name)
- feature: rule items can now be negated (e.g. to compare if client_name does not match helo_name)
- feature: extra verbose mode '-vv' now displays much more debug information
- feature: -L switch to redirect log output to stdout
- feature: new manual section about the parser, other updates
- bugfix:  caching did not work at end_of_data level because of different queue ids, corrected
- bugfix:  all numeric items will now match if the request attribute exceeds the corresponding
           rule item. the negation operator will lead to the opposite effect:
  =============================================================================
   ITEM=VALUE                            TYPE
  =============================================================================
   rblcount=2                            matches if rbl hits   >= 2
   recipient_count=10                    matches if recipients >= 10
   size=12345                            matches if size       >= 12345
   encryption_keysize=256                matches if keysize    >= 256
   encryption_keysize=!!256              matches if keysize    <  256
  =============================================================================
